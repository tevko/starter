@import 'partials/normalize'; // Resets all wierd browser defaults - V3.0.0

@import 'partials/mixins'; // MQ's, Functions, placeholders, and mixins to be used throughout our SASS Files

@import 'compass'; //sometimes this is necessary, sometimes it's not. Remove if you wish

@import 'partials/globals'; // Classes, fonts, and other rules to be used throughout our SASS files

@import 'partials/pages'; // Need a CSS class that targets only your 'about-us' page? You'd put that here

@import 'partials/colors'; // Here we store all of our colors as variables. Makes Changing colors super easy!

//Start Modules - Self contained pieces that make up a site when pieced together - remove and add to the list below as necessary
